Medical Science reveals that nerve cells make an important chemical called Dopamine. Dopamine is responsible for sending signals to the brain that, controls body movements. It makes the motion of body muscles flexible and smooth. When Parkinson attacks, these nerve cells break down and start losing sufficient amount of Dopamine required for normal body movement and control. Parkinson is a progressive disease. It gets worse over time. On time consultancy with specialists help Parkinson Patients in recovering or stabilizing from the disease sooner.",
